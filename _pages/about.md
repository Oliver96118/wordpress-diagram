## About "WordPress at Scale"

WordPress now powers about [1 in every 4 websites](https://ma.tt/2015/11/seventy-five-to-go/) and continues to grow. Many of these sites have massive audiences and traffic and that [trend is accelerating](https://pantheon.io/blog/wordpress-moves-upmarket). In order to serve this growing market, we need more of our developers to understand how to build WordPress sites that scale.
