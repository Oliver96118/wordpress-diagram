## Contributors

The contents of this website are a result of many individual efforts. 

> A list of contributors to the website. This page is still TODO as we gather everyone's preferred one-line bio, headshot, and link. This notice will be removed, and the pages will get cleaned up with some nice formatting when the website itself is published.

Daniel Bachhuber is a hardcore about open source. He’s the Principal at [Hand Built](https://handbuilt.co/), maintains WP-CLI, is a contributing developer to the WP-API project, and believes wholeheartedly in the pull request workflow.

Daniel lives in the suburbs of Portland, Oregon with his wife Leah and daughter Ava. On Fridays at lunch, he likes to take a break and play soccer in the park. If you fancy an invite to his home, he’ll likely make grilled pizza for dinner.
