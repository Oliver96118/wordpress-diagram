## Can WordPress Scale?

### Yes. But there are requirements:

* **Horizontally-scalable architecture**
* **Reverse-proxy page caching**
* **Persistent object cache**
* **Database replication**
* **Optimized search index**
* **Development and deployment workflows**

WordPress can push hundreds of millions, even billions of pageviews a month; it can serve tens of thousands of concurrent logged-in users; and it can be lightning-fast the whole time. It's proven. The question is not whether WordPress itself can scale, but whether or not your implementation is ready.

This site is intended to communicate hard-won best practices from teams that have deep real-world experience in running WordPress at scale. They provide a useful starting place for scalable implementations, for both development teams as well as site owners.
